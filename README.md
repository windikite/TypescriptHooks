My 53rd assignment! This assignment covers utilizing state and hooks with typescript.  

Assignment 1  
I developed a component called Counter that uses state to manage the current number. There are buttons on in the component that allow for incrementing, decrementing and resetting the number on demand.  

I added the component to the App.tsx component to test whether or not it works as expected, and it works perfectly.  

Assignment 2  
I created a component called ShoppingCart, which allows for the manual tracking of items within it. You are able to easily add items to the cart or later remove them. I have also implemented form validation to ensure that only valid items are being created. Additionally, the total cost of the cart is provided at the bottom of the component.
